# Runs the e2e suite against a kind cluster and a MinIO container that this
# script creates and removes again, so running the tests locally does not need
# a cluster, an object store or a set of environment variables to be assembled
# by hand first.
#
# The cluster's kubeconfig is written to a temporary directory and never merged
# into the caller's: ~/.kube/config is untouched and the current context does
# not change. Everything created is removed on exit, including when the tests
# fail or the run is interrupted. FAIL_FAST=true leaves it all up for
# inspection, as it does for the suite itself.
#
# Usage:
#   make -C test/ run-e2e-kind GINKGO_LABELS='Basic && ClusterResource'
#   FEATURES=EnableCSI make -C test/ run-e2e-kind GINKGO_LABELS='BackupVolumeInfo && CSISnapshot'
